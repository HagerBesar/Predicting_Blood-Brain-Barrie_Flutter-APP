# Predicting Blood-Brain Barrie ( Flutter APP )
Flutter Application for Predicting the Blood−Brain Barrie

---
Predicting the ability of chemical species to cross the blood−brain barrier (BBB) is an
active field of research for development and mechanistic understanding in the pharmaceutical industry.

## Dataset
There are many databases for the blood-brain barrier, but we 
used this data because it is for humans and includes all the data 
used as it contains:
 48 attributes of different types.
 44 of them are numeric, 2 string and 2 null cells
